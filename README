The code in this repository is my contribution to a group project in the course IMT3281 on NTNU. I've taken the files I wrote, modified the JavaFX controller and added a main file so that the program can run on its own. I've omitted the unit tests because they were written by our lecturer, Øivind Kolloen.

This program lets you play Ludo, but you control all four players. The group project was to create a server/client application for multiplayer Ludo, but this excerpt only contains the game itself.
